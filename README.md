# University Question Paper Downloader 

This tool simplies accessing previous question papers from my universities's website. Previously, students had to downoad a ZIP file and manually sift through dozens of PDFs. With this tool you can:

1. **Find** question papers based on year/semester
2. **Preview** individual question papers
3. **Download** individual PDFs, instead of a ZIP

## How To Use It
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Finally run the server
   ```
   flask run
   ```
